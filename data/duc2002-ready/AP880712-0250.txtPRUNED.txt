   Kentucky's governor has criticized the federal government for
being too slow in dealing with the drought, and Iowa's governor
warns that farmers in his state still face potential disaster
despite up to five inches of rain over the weekend.
   Crews began installing pumps on barges Monday to haul fresh
water to southern Louisiana towns plagued by rising salt levels in
the lower Mississippi River.
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Jim Wright said in Washington he hopes
that a relief package with disaster payments of up to $100,000 for
drought-stricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready
for floor action in Congress this week.
